                <h3>Eirling Haaland</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the people to look out for during the summer transfer window is Eirling Haaland.
                    <br>
                    After another brilliant season so far after scoring 21 goals in 21 games 
                    <br>
                    it doesn't come a surprise to most that Haaland is at the top of most clubs summer targets.
                    <br>
                    The two Manchester giants, Manchester United and Manchester City are amongst many clubs
                    <br>
                    trying to get his signature. Will we see Haaland leave this summer or does his heart belong
                    <br>
                    in Dortmund.

                <h3>Christiano Ronaldo</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Is Ronaldo on the move?</b>
                    <br>
                    The Eye Of Football understands that Juventus will make Ronaldo available for £25 million  
                    <br>
                    this summer, as according to reports Juventus regret purchasing the player in 2018 because he is
                    <br>
                    too expensive. It is believed that Juventus pay Ronaldo £1 million after every goal scored.
                    <br>
                    You can understand why Juventus would regret that decision after he has scored 97 goals since arriving
                    <br>
                    at the Allianz Arena. I won't be surprised to see a number of clubs from Europes top 5 leagues lining up
                    <br>
                    to get his signature.

                    <b>Who will be at the top of Uunited's transfer targets this summer?</b>
                    <br>
                    There has been a lot of names circulating around Old Trafford regarding

                    <br>
                    <ol>
